Fleet Management System (FMS)

Overview

The Fleet Management System (FMS) is a simulation-based application designed to manage autonomous robots navigating a predefined graph-based map. It provides real-time traffic negotiation, dynamic interactivity, and efficient path planning for robots.

Features

Robot Fleet Management – Add, remove, and monitor robots in real time.

Traffic Manager – Handles collision avoidance and efficient navigation.

Navigation Graph – Stores locations and paths for optimal route calculation.

Dynamic GUI – Visual representation of robot movements and navigation paths.

Error Handling & Logging – Ensures robustness with detailed logs.
